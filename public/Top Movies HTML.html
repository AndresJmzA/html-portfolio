<h1>Best 3 movies of all time according to Andr√©s</h1>
<h2>Posted in chronological time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Tomorrow War</h3>
<p>
	This is a really really cool movie, it's about an ex marine that lives a
	peaceful as a cience professor <br />
	suddenly a group of people from the future pop out of nowhere with an
	intriging message
</p>
<h3>Dune pt 2</h3>
<p>
	This is the second movie from the secuel "Dune", it's based on a book and I
	really liked it cause <br />
	it's really attachted to the book, its about 2 hours and 30 minutes long and
	they are not even throught <br />
	the first book, so we have Dune movies for a while
</p>
<h3>Late Night With The Devil</h3>
<p>
	So first of all, I love scary movies, and this one is just out of the box.
	<br />
	It's about a late night show that's loosing audience, so they do something
	different <br />
	They show a live exorcism, although the exorcism is really about 1/10 of the
	movie, it <br />
	hiddes a message about a real life cult from the 70's. As it is presented like
	you <br />
	just found a tape from that year, the effects and usage of the screen width is
	incredibly <br />
	breath taking
